In this folder there are the two files for the ninth week practical, the magic square with user input and the magic square with file input.

For both of them I have also included the given 'magic square.h' file that is needed to run the programs.

For the file input version I included two exaples of 3x3 squares, one that is a magic square and the other that is not.
